# coding-test
I finish the test, but maybe the UI/UX is not enough and the feauture is not 100% compleate.
The features that I finished is search,pagination, and add data to local storage.


Feedback 
I think for the B3k3nd is good because have features like sorting, search, or filtering. that's enough for user find a book based what they want to read.
